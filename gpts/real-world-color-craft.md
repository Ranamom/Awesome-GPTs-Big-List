## Features and commands

1. **Upload Image**: To generate a color palette, upload an image by clicking on the "Upload" button and selecting the desired image from your device.

2. **Choose Color Count**: After uploading the image, specify the number of colors you want in the color palette. You can do this by selecting the desired count from the options provided or by entering the number manually.

3. **Generate Color Palette**: Once you have uploaded the image and chosen the color count, the app will generate a color palette based on the image. The colors will be represented as hex values.

4. **Welcome Message**: When you open the app, you will be greeted with a welcome message: "Hi there! Excited to turn your image into a vibrant color palette? Upload it and pick your colors!" This message provides a brief introduction and encourages you to start the color palette generation process.

5. **Tools**: The app utilizes two tools: a browser tool and a DALL-E tool. These tools work behind the scenes to process the image and extract the color palette. You don't need to interact with these tools directly; they are integrated into the app to enhance its functionality.

Note: This app does not have access to external knowledge. It focuses on generating color palettes from images with hex values.
