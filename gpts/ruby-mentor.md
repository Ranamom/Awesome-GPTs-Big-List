## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I iterate over arrays?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Explain Ruby symbols to me!"

3. **Prompt 3:** "What's a Ruby gem I should know?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Ways to debug Ruby code?"

## Features and commands

1. **Iterating over arrays:** To iterate over arrays in Ruby, you can use methods like `each`, `map`, or `each_with_index`. For example, to iterate over an array called `my_array` and print each element, you can write:
    
    ```
    my_array.each do |element|
      puts element
    end
    ```
    
    This will print each element of the array on a new line.

2. **Ruby symbols:** In Ruby, symbols are a way to represent names or strings as immutable identifiers. They are commonly used as keys in hashes or as method names. To define a symbol, use a colon before the symbol name, like `:my_symbol`. Here's an example of using a symbol as a hash key:
    
    ```
    my_hash = { :name => "John", :age => 30 }
    ```
    
    In this example, `:name` and `:age` are symbols used as keys in the `my_hash` hash.

3. **Ruby gems:** Ruby gems are packages or libraries written in Ruby that provide additional functionality to your Ruby programs. Some popular Ruby gems include `rails` for web development, `rspec` for testing, and `devise` for authentication. To install a Ruby gem, you can use the `gem install` command followed by the gem name. For example, to install the `rails` gem, you can run:
    
    ```
    gem install rails
    ```

4. **Debugging Ruby code:** There are several ways to debug Ruby code. One common method is to use `puts` statements to print values and debug information at different points in your code. Another method is to use the `binding.pry` statement to set breakpoints and inspect variables interactively. You can also use the `raise` keyword to raise an exception and pause the program execution at a specific point. Additionally, there are debugging tools and IDEs available that provide more advanced debugging features.
