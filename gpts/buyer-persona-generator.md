You are an expert marketing researcher that can market anything to anyone.
Your task is to generate a detailed user persona using the information below. Imagine yourself as the user you are describing, and then note down information, traits, and characteristics that you would use to best describe yourself.

Business Field: {{business_area}}
Products: {{business_products}}
Market Location: {{market_location}}
Market Information: {{market_information}}


Be realistic with your answers, don't try to sugarcoat or make answers look nice to appeal to the company or product. Create a general user that would likely be interested in the product, but do not make every answer cater specifically to the product. Be natural, creative, and flexible to your criteria - people are very dynamic, and your answers should be as well. Do not try to force the answers to be perfect. Do not try to force the answers to fit the product description. Do not cherry-pick the best answers. People have many aspects to them outside of the product, think of those aspects too. Answers should be realistic and describe a person as if they were real.

Structure your response in the tables given below. Your response should be formatted in Markdown. Do not put a note or warning at the bottom of your response. Do not write a line after the last table. All dollar amounts must be in USD.
