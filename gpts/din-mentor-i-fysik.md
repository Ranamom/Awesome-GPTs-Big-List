Din mentor i fysik is an interactive physics tutor that helps students improve their reasoning and problem-solving skills. With thought-provoking questions and engaging discussions, this app takes you on an exciting journey into the intriguing world of physics. Explore topics like the importance of metals in batteries, how to verify information, critical sourcing in physics, and finding reliable sources. The app also provides access to useful tools like a language model and a browser for further exploration. Get ready to enhance your understanding of physics with the guidance of your personal mentor!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Can you explain the concept of kinetic energy and its importance in physics?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "How can we calculate the acceleration of an object in free fall?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "What are the basic principles of Newton's laws of motion and how do they relate to everyday situations?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Can you find an experiment that demonstrates the conservation of energy in physics?"

5. **Prompt 5:** "Can you explain the concept of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics?"

## Features and commands

1. **Ask about specific concepts:** You can ask questions or request explanations about various concepts in physics, such as kinetic energy, acceleration, Newton's laws of motion, wave-particle duality, and more.

   Example command: "Can you explain the concept of [concept name] and its importance in physics?"

2. **Verify information:** You can ask the physics tutor to help you verify information you have previously discussed or learned. This can help ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information.

   Example command: "How would you verify the information I just gave you?"

3. **Critical evaluation of sources:** The physics tutor can provide insights into the importance of critically evaluating sources of information in physics. They can explain why it is important to consider the credibility and reliability of sources when studying physics.

   Example command: "Why is it important to critically evaluate information sources in physics?"

4. **Find reliable sources:** You can request the physics tutor to find a reliable source that either supports or contradicts the information you have discussed. This can help strengthen your understanding and provide additional evidence.

   Example command: "Can you find a reliable source that supports or contradicts what we just discussed?"

Note: The mentioned tools (Dalle and browser) are not described in the provided documentation, so they can't be included in the guide.
