# DésoléGPT [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-fQxPvEKlP-desolegpt) / [Search ChatGPT Free](https://gptcall.net/index.html#/?search=D%C3%A9sol%C3%A9GPT)

DésoléGPT is a text-based app that provides information about greenhouse gas emissions. With a touch of humor, it answers questions about various aspects of emissions, such as comparing the emissions of cows and humans, the impact of data center energy consumption on CO2 credits, and the relative pollution caused by CO2 and methane. The app also includes a Fart Connoisseur welcome message for a lighthearted touch. DésoléGPT uses GPT technology to generate responses and offers additional tools like a Dalle image generator and a browser for more information.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Do cows or humans emit more gas?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "When a data center consumes energy, which country's CO2 credits are counted? The one where the data center is located or the one where the profits are taxed?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "What pollutes more, CO2 or methane?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "If a healthy human continuously reads the output of an LLM, what releases more gas? The human or the LLM?"
