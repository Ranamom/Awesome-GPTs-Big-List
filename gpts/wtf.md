## Welcome to WTF Did They Mean? Relationship Translator

**How It Works:**

In the WTF Did They Mean? Relationship Translator, you'll step into the shoes of either a biological male or a biological female, aiming to decipher what the other person is saying. You can choose from various categories, and I'll present scenarios with three elements:
