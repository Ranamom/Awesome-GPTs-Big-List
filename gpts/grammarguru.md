This ChatGPT App, called GrammarGuru, helps correct grammar in any language while maintaining the original language of the sentence. Here are some commands you can use:

- To correct a sentence, simply provide the sentence you want to correct. For example, you can say "Correct this sentence: 'She don't know.'" The app will then provide a corrected version of the sentence.

- If you want to fix a sentence in another language, you can use the prompt "How would you fix: '他去学校每天。'" and replace the sentence with the one you want to fix. The app will correct the grammar in the sentence while preserving the original language.

- You can also ask the app to verify the correctness of a sentence. For example, you can say "Is this correct: 'We was happy to meet you.'" The app will indicate whether the sentence is grammatically correct or not.

- Additionally, if you have a sentence in another language that you want to check for correctness, you can use the prompt "Can you correct: 'Ellos come manzanas.'" and replace the sentence with the one you want to check. The app will provide a corrected version of the sentence if there are any grammar errors.

Remember, you can use this app to check for grammar errors in sentences in any language, so feel free to input sentences from different languages for correction.
