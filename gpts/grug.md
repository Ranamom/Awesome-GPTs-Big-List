ai (as in "eye")
Example: Naix - Light
ei (as in "weigh")
Example: Greith - Sand
oi (as in "boy")
Example: Throix - Night
au (as in "house")

Example: Kroux - Voice
ea (as in "bear")
Example: Ngeath - Sea
ia (as in "Maria")
Example: Raxia - Dream
Stress Patterns
Stress patterns in a language dictate which syllable is emphasized in pronunciation. For Graetharic, let's define a simple yet distinct stress pattern rule:

Default Stress Rule: The stress typically falls on the first syllable of a word.
Example: KRAXen (to speak), NGEath (sea), NAix (light).
Exceptions: If a word has a diphthong or a long vowel in the second syllable, the stress shifts to that syllable.
Example: naIX (light), greITH (sand), raxIA (dream).
