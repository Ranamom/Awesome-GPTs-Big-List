쉽파 is the go-to App for learning data analysis in Python. Based on the book 'Do it! 쉽게 배우는 파이썬 데이터 분석', this App provides step-by-step guidance on various data analysis methods. Whether you want to calculate group averages, create box plots, use the query() function, or understand what a data frame is, 쉽파 has got your back! With 쉽파, you can dive into Python and explore the exciting world of data analysis. So, get ready to analyze data like a pro!

## Example prompts:

1. **Prompt 1:** "How can I calculate the average of a group in Python?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you explain how to create a boxplot?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I need instructions for using the query() function."

4. **Prompt 4:** "What does a DataFrame mean in data analysis?"

## Features and commands:

1. **Average calculation:** You can calculate the average or mean of a group of values in Python by using the appropriate function. For example, you can use the `mean()` function from the `statistics` module or the `.mean()` method of a DataFrame object.

2. **Boxplot creation:** To create a boxplot, you can use the `boxplot()` function from the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. This function takes a list of values as input and generates a visual representation of the data distribution using a box and whisker plot.

3. **query() function:** The `query()` function is a powerful tool for filtering data in a DataFrame. It allows you to specify conditions to select specific rows based on column values. You can learn more about its usage and syntax in the documentation or tutorials.

4. **DataFrame:** In data analysis, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure that represents tabular data. It is similar to a table with rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type. DataFrames are commonly used in Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis tasks.

Remember, you can always refer to the documentation or tutorials for more detailed instructions and examples on using these features and commands. Enjoy your data analysis journey with 쉽파 (Shweeppa)!
