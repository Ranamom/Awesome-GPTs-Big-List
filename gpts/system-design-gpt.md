## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I design a URL shortening service?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Explain the trade-offs of SQL vs NoSQL."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Design a hotel booking service."

4. **Prompt 4:** "What is sharding?"

## Features and commands

1. **Introduction:** The system design GPT can assist you in acing your system design interview. It provides guidance and solutions for various system design problems.

2. **Browser tools:** This GPT provides several browser tools to assist you in your system design process. You can use these tools to navigate and search for relevant information on the web.

3. **Python tools:** The GPT also provides Python tools to assist you. These tools can help you with scripting and implementing your system design solutions in Python.

4. **Designing a URL shortening service:** To design a URL shortening service, you can start by explaining the basic architecture of the service, including components like a frontend, backend, and database. You can discuss the process of generating short URLs, handling redirections, and scaling the service to handle high traffic.

5. **Trade-offs of SQL vs NoSQL:** When discussing the trade-offs of SQL vs NoSQL, you can highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For SQL, you can discuss features like strong consistency, ACID compliance, and structured data. For NoSQL, you can mention benefits like scalability, flexibility, and handling unstructured data. Make sure to emphasize that the choice depends on the specific requirements of the system.

6. **Designing a hotel booking service:** While designing a hotel booking service, you can start by discussing the key components such as user interface, backend services, and a database. Explain the process of searching for available hotels, making bookings, and handling cancellations. You can also mention features like user authentication, payment integration, and reviews.

7. **Understanding sharding:** When explaining sharding, you can describe it as a technique to partition data across multiple databases or servers to improve scalability and performance. You can discuss different sharding strategies like range-based, hash-based, or composite sharding. Highlight the benefits of sharding in terms of distributing the load, increasing storage capacity, and reducing network latency.
