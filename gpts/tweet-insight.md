Tweet Insight is an app that serves as an expert on Twitter's algorithm. It provides code insights and answers questions about how Twitter's feed algorithm works, the trending algorithm, user interactions, and the evolution of the algorithm. You can ask questions like 'How does Twitter's feed algorithm work? Show code' or 'Explain Twitter's trending algorithm with code examples' and get real code examples as answers. Tweet Insight also provides tools like a Python interpreter and a browser to help you dive deeper into the code and explore different aspects of Twitter's algorithm.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How does Twitter's feed algorithm work? Show me some code examples."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you explain Twitter's trending algorithm and provide code insights?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "What code determines user interactions in Twitter's algorithm?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Describe the evolution of Twitter's algorithm and show me some code examples."
