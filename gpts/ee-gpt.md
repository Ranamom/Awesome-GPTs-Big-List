# EE-GPT [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-4fpcmwkT2-ee-gpt) / [Search ChatGPT Free](https://gptcall.net/index.html#/?search=EE-GPT)

EE-GPT is an open-source search engine and troubleshooter designed specifically for electrical engineers. With EE-GPT, you can submit your questions, corrections, and feedback to the community. Whether you need help calculating the input referred noise of a CS amplifier, writing a SR latch in Verilog, or setting up a S-parameter testbench in Cadence, EE-GPT has got you covered. Managed by Louis Liu, a PhD student at UCSD, EE-GPT promotes knowledge sharing and collaboration among electrical engineers. Use the *CORRECTION* command to suggest changes, and enjoy being part of this supportive community!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I calculate the input referred noise of a CS amplifier?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you write a Verilog code for a SR latch?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I need an example code for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python."

4. **Prompt 4:** "How can I set up a S-parameter testbench in Cadence?"

## Features and commands

1. **Search:** You can ask questions related to electrical engineering, such as calculating input referred noise or setting up a testbench. Simply provide your question or request and the app will try to provide you with relevant information.

2. **Correction:** If you have suggestions for improvements or corrections to the information provided by the app, you can use the command *CORRECTION* followed by your suggestion. This will allow you to contribute to the open-source community of electrical engineers and help improve the accuracy and quality of information.

3. **Browser Tool:** The app has a browser tool that can display web content. It can be used to show search results or provide additional reference materials.

4. **DALLE Tool:** The app also has a DALLE tool, which is capable of generating images based on textual descriptions. However, it may not be directly relevant to electrical engineering.

5. **Python Tool:** The app provides a Python tool that can execute Python code. You can use this tool to run code snippets or examples related to electrical engineering tasks.

Note: Technical language is used in this guide as electrical engineering requires specific terminology and concepts.
