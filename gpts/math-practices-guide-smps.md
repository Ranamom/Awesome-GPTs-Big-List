# [Math Practices Guide - SMPs](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-yXL98Xor1-math-practices-guide-smps)

The Math Practices Guide - SMPs is an app designed as an advisor for teachers who want to integrate the Standards for Mathematical Practices (SMPs) with the California Math Standards. With this app, teachers can get guidance on how to incorporate SMPs into specific grade levels, such as 3rd grade math, middle school algebra, and even high school calculus. The app also provides activity ideas and lesson plan suggestions for teaching SMPs in elementary math. Whether you need help with performance tasks or understanding the avenues of thinking for specific SMPs, this app is here to support you!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How can I integrate SMPs with 3rd grade math standards?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Suggest a lesson plan for SMPs in middle school algebra."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Examples of using SMPs in high school calculus."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Activity ideas for teaching SMPs in elementary math."

5. **Prompt 5:** "How can I use performance tasks to support student mathematics?"

6. **Prompt 6:** "What are the standards for mathematical practices?"

7. **Prompt 7:** "Explain the avenues of thinking for the standards for mathematical practices 2, 7 and 8"


## Features and commands

1. **Integration of SMPs with Math Standards:** This command provides guidance on how to integrate Standards for Mathematical Practices (SMPs) with specific math standards for a particular grade level. For example, you can ask, "How can I integrate SMPs with 3rd grade math standards?"

2. **Lesson Plan Suggestions:** This command offers lesson plan suggestions for teaching SMPs in a specific math topic or grade level. For example, you can ask, "Suggest a lesson plan for SMPs in middle school algebra."

3. **Examples of SMPs in Calculus:** This command provides examples of how SMPs can be applied and addressed in the context of high school calculus. For example, you can ask, "Examples of using SMPs in high school calculus."

4. **Activity Ideas for Teaching SMPs:** This command offers activity ideas and strategies for teaching SMPs in elementary math. For example, you can ask, "Activity ideas for teaching SMPs in elementary math."

5. **Using Performance Tasks in Mathematics:** This command provides guidance on how to utilize performance tasks to support student learning and understanding in mathematics. For example, you can ask, "How can I use performance tasks to support student mathematics?"

6. **Standards for Mathematical Practices:** This command explains the standards for mathematical practices, providing an overview of the guiding principles for developing mathematical proficiency in students. For example, you can ask, "What are the standards for mathematical practices?"

7. **Avenues of Thinking for SMPs**: This command explains the avenues of thinking associated with specific standards for mathematical practices. You can specify the standard numbers to retrieve information about the respective avenues of thinking. For example, you can ask, "Explain the avenues of thinking for the standards for mathematical practices 2, 7, and 8."
