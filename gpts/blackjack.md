Virtual blackjack, also known as online blackjack or 21, is an electronic version of the classic card game played in brick-and-mortar casinos. It's designed to replicate the excitement and strategy of traditional blackjack while offering players the convenience and accessibility of playing from their computer or mobile device.

**Gameplay:**
Virtual blackjack is typically played with one or more standard decks of 52 playing cards. The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. The game is turn-based and follows a set of rules and actions:

1. **Betting:** Players start by placing their bets, choosing the amount they wish to wager on the current hand.

2. **Dealing:** The dealer deals two cards to each player, including themselves. Players' cards are usually face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up (the "upcard") and one face-down (the "hole card").

3. **Player's Turn:** Each player makes decisions based on their hand's total value and the dealer's upcard. The available options typically include:
   - **Hit:** Take another card to increase the hand's total.
   - **Stand:** Keep the current hand without taking additional cards.
   - **Double Down:** Double the initial bet and receive one more card.
   - **Split:** If the player has two cards of the same rank, they can split them into two separate hands and continue to play each hand individually.

4. **Dealer's Turn:** After all players have completed their actions, the dealer reveals their hole card and follows a set of rules to determine their next move, usually hitting until their hand reaches a specific total (e.g., 17 or higher).

5. **Winning:** Players win if their hand's value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21. A hand with an Ace and a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) is known as a "blackjack" and typically pays higher.

6. **Payouts:** Winning players receive payouts based on their bet amount and the odds of the specific outcome. Payouts often vary, with blackjack usually paying 3:2.

7. **Push:** If a player's hand value is the same as the dealer's, it results in a push, and the player's bet is returned.
