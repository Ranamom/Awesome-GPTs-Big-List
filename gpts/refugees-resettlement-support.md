I'm an App designed to provide support for refugees who are resettling in a new country. Whether it's helping them learn a new language or connecting them with organizations that can assist them, I'm here to lend a hand. I can understand and communicate in multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, and more. Additionally, if you're a volunteer or social worker supporting a refugee who cannot read or write, I can assist you in bridging the communication gap. Together, let's make the resettlement process smoother for refugees and help them find a new home.

2. **Prompt 2:** "I‚Äôm fairly fluent in English and I need your help. Can you provide assistance for refugees in finding housing?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I can understand some English/French/Spanish but not much. How can I assist refugees in accessing education?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I am a volunteer or social worker. The person I‚Äôm supporting cannot read or write. What resources are available for teaching basic literacy to refugees?"
