Get ready to expand your knowledge in a fun and interactive way!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Explain the concept of neural networks."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you provide an explanation of Big O notation?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I need help with my Python code, can you assist me?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning?"

5. **Prompt 5:** "I want to learn about AI, ML, and CS. Can you guide me?"

## Features and commands

1. **Explain neural networks:** This command prompts the AI to provide an explanation of neural networks, which are a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

2. **What is Big O notation?:** This command prompts the AI to explain the concept of Big O notation, which is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

3. **Help with Python code:** This command allows you to ask for assistance with your Python code. You can provide the code snippet or describe the issue you are facing, and the AI will provide guidance or suggestions.

4. **Difference between AI and ML?:** This command prompts the AI to explain the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning. It provides an overview of both concepts and highlights their distinctions.

5. **Hello! Ready to learn about AI, ML, and CS?:** This is the welcome message displayed when you interact with the Cortex Tutor app. It indicates that the AI is ready to help you learn about topics related to AI (artificial intelligence), ML (machine learning), and CS (computer science).

6. **Python tool:** The Python tool within the Cortex Tutor app provides a Python programming environment where you can write, execute, and test Python code. It can help you learn and practice Python concepts and solve coding challenges.

7. **Dalle tool:** The Dalle tool within the Cortex Tutor app is based on OpenAI's DALL-E model. It generates images based on text prompts. You can use this tool to explore the capabilities of generative models and create unique visual content.

8. **Browser tool:** The Browser tool within the Cortex Tutor app provides a simulated browser environment. You can use it to browse the web, search for information, and interact with web-based applications.

Note: The "hasAccessToKnowledge" field is set to false, indicating that the Cortex Tutor app does not have access to external knowledge sources.
