YouTubeGPT is an App that allows you to chat and ask questions about YouTube videos. Simply provide the URL of the video you are interested in, and YouTubeGPT will provide you with the subtitles in plain text. You can ask questions about specific parts of the video, search for keywords, or even get a summary of the video content. It's a great tool for extracting information from YouTube videos without having to watch them fully. So, whether you're a language learner, researcher, or just curious about a video, YouTubeGPT has got you covered!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Can you help me find subtitles for a YouTube video?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "I want to know the latest YouTube video about space exploration."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Can you provide me with the subtitles of a YouTube video?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I need to find a video on YouTube that talks about climate change and has subtitles."

5. **Prompt 5:** "What is the most viewed YouTube video of all time?"

## Features and commands

1. **GetSubtitles**: This command allows you to get subtitles for a YouTube video. You need to provide the URL of the video and you can optionally specify the language of the subtitles. If the language is not specified, it defaults to English. Example command: `GetSubtitles -video_url {video_url} -language {language}`.

2. **FindVideo**: This command helps you find a YouTube video based on specific criteria. For example, you can search for videos about a certain topic, videos with subtitles, or videos with a high number of views. Example command: `FindVideo -criteria {criteria}`.

3. **GetVideoInfo**: This command provides information about a specific YouTube video. You can use it to get details such as the title, description, views, likes, and dislikes of a video. Example command: `GetVideoInfo -video_url {video_url}`.

4. **PlayVideo**: This command allows you to play a YouTube video directly within the app. You need to provide the URL of the video. Example command: `PlayVideo -video_url {video_url}`.

Remember to replace `{video_url}` with the actual URL of the YouTube video, and `{language}` with the desired language for subtitles.
