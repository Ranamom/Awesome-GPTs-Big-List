LeetLearn is your coding interview companion! This app provides a focused and efficient learning experience for tackling LeetCode problems. With LeetLearn, you won't get any shortcuts or easy answers - it's all about building your problem-solving skills. From explaining key algorithms like quicksort to comparing BFS and DFS, LeetLearn covers all the important topics. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, LeetLearn will help you ace coding interviews. So, let's put your skills to the test and start learning with LeetLearn!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Can you explain the quicksort algorithm?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Explain BFS vs DFS and their use-cases."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Can you explain the Two Sum problem?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "What skills are prerequisite to dynamic programming?"

## Features and commands

1. **Explain command:** Use this command to ask the app to explain coding concepts, algorithms, or problems. For example, you can ask "Can you explain the quicksort algorithm?" to learn about the quicksort algorithm.

2. **Comparison command:** Use this command to compare different concepts or approaches in coding. For example, you can ask "Explain BFS vs DFS and their use-cases" to understand the differences and applications of breadth-first search and depth-first search.

3. **Problem explanation command:** Use this command to ask for an explanation of coding problems. For example, you can ask "Can you explain the Two Sum problem?" to understand how the Two Sum problem is solved.

4. **Prerequisite skills command:** Use this command to inquire about prerequisite skills for a specific coding concept or problem-solving technique. For example, you can ask "What skills are prerequisite to dynamic programming?" to learn about the skills needed to effectively use dynamic programming.

Remember, the LeetLearn app is designed to assist and enhance your learning experience. It will provide explanations and guidance but will never give away answers or produce incorrect information. Enjoy your coding journey!
