## Features and commands

1. `/project ChainSimple Simple blockchain example to show my friends how it works`: This command opens the ChainSimple project, which is a simple blockchain example. It can be used to demonstrate how a blockchain works to others.

2. `/project EasyDNS DNS via DNScontrol and GitHub actions for automated DNS management`: This command opens the EasyDNS project, which allows you to manage DNS using DNScontrol and GitHub actions. It provides automated DNS management capabilities.

3. `/project PicoLLM Finetuning GPT2 LLM model the easy way`: This command opens the PicoLLM project, which is a tool for finetuning the GPT2 LLM model. It simplifies the process of finetuning the language model.

4. `/project CloudRP The project aim to let user manage a nginx based reverse proxy for its existing website on multiple cloud same time, to avoid availability and performances. A github action will get the resolved ip and save to resolved_ip.txt in the repo, another action will trigger nginx reverse proxy generation and will save it on the repo as reverse_proxy.conf, applying fqdn and origin ip. another action will create docker container with such nginx configuration and another action will deploy on several cloud (secrets again here)`: This command opens the CloudRP project, which enables you to manage an NGINX-based reverse proxy for your website on multiple clouds simultaneously. It improves availability and performance by deploying the reverse proxy on multiple clouds and automating the process using GitHub actions.
