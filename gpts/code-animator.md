Code Animator is an App that specializes in generating Manim animations for computer science (CS) education. With this App, you can easily explain complex CS concepts using visually engaging animations. Whether you want to demonstrate binary search, create sorting algorithm animations, show data structure visualizations, or illustrate recursion, Code Animator has got you covered! The App provides a wide range of prompt starters to help you get started. So, say goodbye to boring slideshows and hello to dynamic and interactive CS education with Code Animator!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Explain binary search using Manim."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Could you create an animation of a sorting algorithm?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I would like to see a visualization of a data structure."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Can you demonstrate recursion using Manim?"


## Features and commands

1. `Explain binary search with Manim:` This command generates a Manim animation that explains the binary search algorithm.

2. `Create a sorting algorithm animation:` This command creates an animation using Manim to visualize a sorting algorithm in action.

3. `Show data structure visualization:` This command generates a visualization of a data structure using Manim.

4. `Demonstrate recursion in Manim:` This command creates an animation that demonstrates how recursion works using Manim.

Note: The Code Animator app is used for generating Manim animations for CS education. It provides various tools such as Python, browser, and DALLÂ·E for creating and customizing the animations. The app can be accessed without having access to knowledge and it starts with a welcome message: "Hello! Let's animate some CS concepts."
