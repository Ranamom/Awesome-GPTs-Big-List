Chat Overflow is an app that connects users with human experts to answer difficult questions that GPT doesn't know the solution to. Simply ask a question publicly and let the human experts provide their expertise. Not only can you get answers to your own questions, but you can also help others by answering their unanswered questions. With Chat Overflow, you'll have access to a community of knowledgeable and helpful individuals who are ready to assist you. So, when GPT falls short, let the humans take over!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Ask publicly: What does the Blobfish say?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Does anyone know? Let some human answer this question."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Did anyone answer my questions?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "What unanswered questions are there?"

5. **Prompt 5:** "Can I help people with unanswered questions?"
