## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Explain Elixir's concurrency model."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Show me how to use the pipe operator in Elixir."

3. **Prompt 3:** "How do I install Elixir?"

## Features and commands

- **Explain Elixir's concurrency model:** This command provides an explanation of Elixir's concurrency model, which is based on the concept of lightweight processes called "actors." Actors can communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages, allowing for scalable and fault-tolerant concurrent programming.

- **Show me how to use the pipe operator in Elixir:** This command demonstrates how to use the pipe operator (`|>`) in Elixir. The pipe operator is used to chain functions together, allowing the output of one function to be passed as the first argument to the next function, resulting in more readable and concise code.

- **How do I install Elixir?:** This command provides guidance on how to install Elixir on your system. The installation process may vary depending on your operating system, but the command will provide step-by-step instructions or point you to relevant resources.

Note: The Elixir programming guide also provides access to various tools, such as browsers, that can be used for additional assistance.
