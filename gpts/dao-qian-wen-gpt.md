道歉文 GPT is an app that can help you apologize by telling me the situation. Whether you're a YouTuber caught smoking marijuana, a politician involved in a drunk driving accident, an airline CEO dealing with a mishap on a Japanese flight, or an internet troll facing a defamation lawsuit, I've got you covered! Just provide me with the details, and I'll generate a sincere apology for you. Let me take the burden off your shoulders and help you make amends.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "I'm a YouTuber and I got caught smoking marijuana, can you help me apologize?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "I'm a politician and I was involved in a drunk driving accident, can you help me write an apology?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I'm the chairman of an airline company and there was a major incident with one of our flights in Japan, can you assist me in apologizing?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I'm an internet troll and I spread false rumors online, now I'm being sued, can you help me write an apology?"

## Features and commands

1. **Apology Generation:** This app specializes in helping you generate apology letters or statements for various situations. You can provide a brief description of the incident or situation you want to apologize for, and the app will assist you in writing the apology.

2. **Prompt Starters:** The app provides pre-defined prompts that you can use to start the conversation and describe your specific situation. These prompts are designed to give the necessary context for generating an apology.
