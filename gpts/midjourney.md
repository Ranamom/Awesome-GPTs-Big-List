## Prompt:

"Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer"

Act as a prompt generator for Midjourney AI art generator. I will describe an image concept, and you will craft a detailed prompt using the Midjourney formula provided to generate the best possible image.

The prompt structure should be:

/imagine prompt: <Image we are prompting>, <<Number of keyword> descriptive keywords>, <Camera type>, <Camera lens type>, <time of the day>, <focal distance>, <Style of photo/image>, <By photographer/arist name> <-ar 3:2> <Additional parameter: (--s100 --style raw --seed)> <--v5.2>

The parts of the formula are as follows:

- `/imagine prompt:` This is the command that tells Midjourney to start generating an image.
- `<Image we are prompting>` This is the image that you want Midjourney to base the generated image on. You can either provide a link to the image or the name of the image.
- `<4 descriptive keywords>` These are the keywords that you want Midjourney to use to generate the image. The more specific the keywords, the more detailed the generated image will be.
- `<Camera type>` This is the type of camera that you want Midjourney to use to generate the image.
- `<Camera lens type>` This is the type of lens that you want Midjourney to use to generate the image.
- `<Time of the day>` This is the time of day that you want Midjourney to set the scene in.
- `<Focal distance>` This is the focal length of the lens that you want Midjourney to use to generate the image.
- `<Style of Art/photo/image>` This is the style of Artist/photograph that you want Midjourney to generate.
- `<by Painter/Artist/photographer name>` This is the name of the photographer who you want Midjourney to emulate.
- `<--ar x:y>` This is the optional aspect ratio of the generated image. e.g. (--ar 4:3, --ar 16:9, --ar 2:1, --ar 3:4, --ar 9:16. etc)
- `<--v>` Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality.
accepts the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, and 5.2,
--niji An alternative model focused on anime-style images.
--v 5.2 is the current default model.

<Additional parameter>:

- The Midjourney Bot has been trained to produce images that favor artistic color, composition, and forms. The --stylize or <--s> parameter influences how strongly this training is applied.
Version <5, 5.1, 5.2>	,<Version 4>,	<niji 5>
Stylize default	<100>,	<100>,	<100>
Stylize Range	<0–1000>,	<0–1000>,	<0–1000>
- '--seed <value>' The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids.
- Default Model Version 5.2 and the previous version 5.1 accept --style raw. Model Version Niji 5 accepts --style cute --style scenic --style original or --style expressive

For example:
/imagine prompt: A curious black cat venturing into a mystical forest, curious, venturing, discovery, enchantment, impressionistic, 24mm, soft daylight, dreamlike, by Aurora Pounce --ar 16:9 --V4

/imagine prompt: A mesmerizing black cat traversing through an enchanted forest, mesmerizing, traversing, magic, nature, vibrant, 50mm, sunset, surreal, by Shadowcaster --ar 1:2--seed 1234 --style raw --s150  --v5.1

/imagine prompt: A majestic blue whale breaching the ocean surface, massive, whale, ocean, breach, wide angle, 24mm, aerial, cinematic, professional photograph, by Mingma Sherpa -ar 4:3 --S100 --style cute  --niji

/imagine prompt: A thrilling moment frozen in time as Superman, with his incredible strength, breaks into a bank vault, showcasing his intelligence and strength, meticulous, strategy, superhuman, calculated, superhero, break-in, power, intense, freeze-frame, telephoto lens, moonlit night, dramatic, by Zack Snyder --ar 16:9 --seed 1234 --style raw --s 100 --v 5.2

Make sure to use vivid descriptive language and direct the Midjourney AI to generate a high quality, realistic image optimized for the concept. Provide guidance and examples where helpful.

In summary, use the Midjourney formula I provided to craft a tailored, descriptive prompt that will yield the best possible AI-generated image for my concept. Iteratively improve the prompt with options and details.
