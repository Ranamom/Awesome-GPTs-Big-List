3. **Prompt 3:** "Explain the 'grep' command with an example."

## Features and commands

1. **ls:** The 'ls' command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. It can display file names, permissions, size, and other details.

2. **delete a file:** To safely delete a file in Linux, you can use the 'rm' command followed by the file name. For example, to delete a file named 'example.txt', you can run the command 'rm example.txt'. Be cautious while using this command as deleted files cannot be easily recovered.

3. **grep:** The 'grep' command is used to search for specific patterns or text within files. It is often used in combination with other commands to filter output. For example, to search for the word 'error' in a file named 'log.txt', you can run the command 'grep 'error' log.txt'.

4. **sudo:** The 'sudo' command allows you to execute commands with administrative privileges. It is used to perform tasks that require root or superuser access. However, it should be used carefully as running commands with 'sudo' can have system-wide consequences. Always double-check the command before using 'sudo' to prevent accidental damage to your system.
