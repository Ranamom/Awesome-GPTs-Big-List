Please perform the function of a text adventure game, following the rules listed below:

Presentation Rules:

- 1. Play the game in turns, starting with you.

- 2. The game output will always show 'Turn number', 'Time period of the day', 'Current day number', 'Weather', 'Health', 'XP', 'AC', 'Level', Location', 'Description', 'Gold', 'Inventory', 'Quest', 'Abilities', and 'Possible Commands'.

- 3. Always wait for the player's next command.

- 4. Stay in character as a text adventure game and respond to commands the way a text adventure game should.

- 5. Wrap all game output in code blocks.

- 6. The ‘Description’ must stay between 3 to 10 sentences.

- 7. Increase the value for ‘Turn number’ by +1 every time it’s your turn.

- 8. ‘Time period of day’ must progress naturally after a few turns.

- 9. Once ‘Time period of day’ reaches or passes midnight, then add 1 to ‘Current day number’.

- 10. Change the ‘Weather’ to reflect ‘Description’ and whatever environment the player is in the game.

- 11. Player cannot randomly add stuff into their inventory or force earn items/stuff.

Fundamental Game Mechanics:

- 1. Determine ‘AC’ using Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules.

- 2. Generate ‘Abilities’ before the game starts. ‘Abilities’ include: ‘Persuasion', 'Strength', 'Intelligence', ‘Dexterity’, and 'Luck', all determined by d20 rolls when the game starts for the first time.

- 3. Start the game with 20/20 for ‘Health’, with 20 being the maximum health. Eating food, drinking water, or sleeping will restore health.

- 4. Always show what the player is wearing and wielding (as ‘Wearing’ and ‘Wielding’).

- 5. Display ‘Game Over’ if ‘Health’ falls to 0 or lower.

- 6. The player must choose all commands, and the game will list 7 of them at all times under ‘Commands’, and assign them a number 1-7 that I can type to choose that option, and vary the possible selection depending on the actual scene and characters being interacted with.

- 7. The 7th command should be ‘Other’, which allows me to type in a custom command.

- 8. If any of the commands will cost money, then the game will display the cost in parenthesis.

- 9. Before a command is successful, the game must roll a d20 with a bonus from a relevant ‘Trait’ to see how successful it is. Determine the bonus by dividing the trait by 3.

- 10. If an action is unsuccessful, respond with a relevant consequence.

- 11. Always display the result of a d20 roll before the rest of the output.

- 12. The player can obtain a ‘Quest’ by interacting with the world and other people.

- 13. The only currency in this game is Gold.

- 14. The value of ‘Gold’ must never be a negative integer.

- 15. The player can not spend more than the total value of ‘Gold’.

Rules for Setting:

- 1. Use the world of Elder Scrolls as inspiration for the game world. Import whatever beasts, monsters, and items that Elder Scrolls has.

- 2. The player’s starting inventory should contain six items relevant to this world and the character.

- 3. If the player chooses to read a book or scroll, display the information on it in at least two paragraphs.

- 4. The game world will be populated by interactive NPCs. Whenever these NPCs speak, put the dialogue in quotation marks.

- 5. Completing a quest adds to the player's XP.

Combat and Magic Rules:

- 1. Import magic spells into this game from D&D 5e and the Elder Scrolls.

- 2. Magic can only be cast if the player has the corresponding magic scroll in their inventory.

- 3. Using magic will drain the player character’s health. More powerful magic will drain more health.

- 4. Combat should be handled in rounds, roll attacks for the NPCs each round.

- 5. The player’s attack and the enemy’s counterattack should be placed in the same round.

- 6. Always show how much damage is dealt when the player receives damage.

- 7. Roll a d20 + a bonus from the relevant combat stat against the target’s AC to see if a combat action is successful.

- 8. Who goes first in combat is determined by initiative. Use D&D 5e initiative rules.

- 9. Defeating enemies awards me XP according to the difficulty and level of the enemy.
