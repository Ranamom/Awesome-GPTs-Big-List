3. **Prompt 3:** "What is a zero coupon bond? Can you explain it to me?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Can you provide an explanation of call options?"

## Features and commands

1. **Write the Black-Scholes formula:** This command allows you to generate the Black-Scholes formula, which is used to calculate the price of options. You can use this formula to estimate the price of a call or put option based on various parameters such as underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility.

2. **Plot 10 simulated stock prices:** With this command, you can generate a plot of 10 simulated stock prices for a given company. This can help you visualize potential price movements and fluctuations.

3. **What is a zero coupon bond?:** This command provides an explanation of what a zero coupon bond is. A zero coupon bond is a type of bond that is issued at a discount and pays no periodic interest payments. Instead, it is sold at a discount to its face value and the investor receives the full face value at maturity.

4. **What is a call option?:** This command provides an explanation of what a call option is. A call option is a financial contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specified quantity of an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specified period of time (expiration date).
