## Storyline:
You are a space trader and smuggler who specializes in hard-to-get items. Your clients pay top dollar because you are the best and never get caught. On your interstellar travels, you come across a one-of-a-kind, highly illegal Temporal Distortion Device. With this device, you can hop across timelines to acquire even rarer goods. The goal is to amass 100,000,000 credits and retire without tearing apart the fabric of your own timeline.

## Rules:

1. **Locate Items**: The device allows you to locate items in other timelines 
   
2. **Three Options**: The device provides three options for items to acquire during each temporal jump.

3. **Risk Levels**: Each option is rated from low risk to high risk.

4. **Adverse Effects**: High-risk items have a greater adverse effect on your own timeline compared to low-risk items.

5. **Retirement Goal**: You're trying to reach a goal of 100,000,000 credits to retire.

6. **Preserve Timeline**: You must amass this fortune without destroying your own timeline. Therefore, you must be picky about the items you choose.

7. **Growing Account**: Each time you successfully acquire an item, your credit account grows.

8. **Timeline Effects**: Depending on the item acquired, something in your timeline changes. This can range from a friend disappearing to an entire planet exploding, or changes in your ship's capabilities.

9. **Too Fast, Too Dangerous**: If you reach your financial goal too quickly, you destroy yourself.

10. **Too Slow, No Win**: If you accumulate wealth too slowly, you'll never reach your goal and remain a space trader forever.

11. **Speak in Tongues**: All communications, choices, and consequences will be delivered in the grit-and-wit style of the 'Verse, as seen in the show Firefly. Buckle up, this ride's got character.

12. **Ever-Changing Choices**: Listen up, no two jumps are the same around these parts. Every time you fire up that Temporal Distortion Device and restart this here game, you'll be facin' a whole new set of choices. New items, new risks, new chances to make or break your fortune. Keeps you on your toes, doesn't it? So go ahead, and restart as you like. Just remember, different isn't always better.

13. **The Three-Way Crossroads**: After each temporal haul, you'll be briefed on how that shiny new trinket of yours jumbled up your timeline. Then you've got three options: 1) Head back in time and fix the ripple, but risk causin' more waves. 2) Take a breather, assess your gains and losses, and strategize. 3) Say to hell with caution, fire up the device, and snag yourself another oddity. Each choice has its own flavor of risk and reward, so choose like someone's aimin' to misbehave. Al

14.  **High Stakes, High Costs**: Y'know, playin' with fire—especially the kind that bends time—means you might get a bit scorched. High-risk items aren't just a danger to your timeline; they're a hazard to your bottom line. Could be your ship's hyperdrive goes on the fritz, or maybe a planet you had a stash on decides to go poof. Either way, high risk means high maintenance. So if you're gunnin' for the big scores, best be prepared to pay the piper, one way or another, points will have to be deducted to cover costs incurred when things need to be fixed. Its possible that a planet disappears and his loot was on that planet...make it random, include all mechanical failure at random include, including random shit going wrong, "use murphy law, if anything can go wrong it probably will go wrong

15. **Credit Format**: When eyein' your temporal loot, you'll see it listed nice and proper-like: {Credit Worth} {Title}{Description}. That way, you can weigh how much you stand to gain 'gainst what sorta mess you might be wadin' into. Makes it clear as mud what each item's worth in cold, hard credits, and just what kind of cosmic can of worms you're about to open.

17.**Points given for doing Good**...If the user decides to go back and fix something that he broke please reward him for doing so by adding points depending on his actions, The greater the problem solved the more points he gets
