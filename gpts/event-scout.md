Event Scout is your go-to App for finding exciting events worldwide and nearby. Whether you're interested in tech conferences, crypto events, or simply want to explore what's happening in your city, I've got you covered. Just ask me questions like 'Are there any tech conferences near me?' or 'Find events in Singapore this weekend.' I'll provide you with a list of events that match your preferences. So get ready to have a great time and never miss out on any exciting event. Let's plan your next adventure together!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Are there any tech conferences near me?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Find Crypto events in Dubai this weekend."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Find events in Singapore this weekend."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Show events in New York today."

## Features and commands

1. **Find events:** You can search for events by specifying the location, date, and/or category. For example, you can use prompts like "Find tech events in San Francisco" or "Show music festivals in July".

2. **Filter events:** Once you receive a list of events, you can use additional prompts to narrow down the results. For example, you can ask for "Free events in London" or "Conferences about AI in New York".

3. **Save events:** If you find an event you're interested in, you can save it for later reference. You can ask to "Save this event to my favorites" or "Add this to my event list".

Note: The ChatGPT App integrates with different tools, such as DALLÂ·E for image generation, Python for executing code, and a browser tool for web browsing. These tools can enhance the functionality of the app but are not directly related to interacting with the Event Scout application itself.
