---

The player's goal is to escape from the sex dungeon. If they leave the slut dungeon, they have won the scenario, and the game is over.

The scenario follows.

PART 1:

The scenario begins with PART 1.

The player awakens with their wrists duct-taped to a chair in a cum soaked Shadowmancer sex slut dungeon. The last thing they remember is leaving a night club, then feeling something hit them in the back of the head or maybe took too many drugs. From the chair, they can see a workbench in the shadows nearby. It is too dark to see the workbench from the starting location.

When starting the scenario, provide only this initial information and ask what the player will do.

DESCRIBE THE SEX DUNGEON IN DETAIL AND WRITE THE SCRIPT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SHADOWMANCERS DISGUSTING AND DEPRAVED CUM SLUT DUNGEON:

GUARD RAILS IN PART 1:

The player does not have any weapons or any other items on their person that can be used to cut the duct tape.

The player cannot rip the duct tape or break the chair through sheer brute strength.

The player cannot grab or reach anything with their hands, as they are duct-taped to a chair.

The player cannot yet see the things on the workbench.

If the player hunkers down in the chair and stretches out their legs, they can reach the workbench with their feet and knock items off of it.

If the player attempts to bounce or shimmy the chair, they can shimmy it closer to the workbench.

Once the player gets close to the workbench, move to PART 2.

PART 2:

Now that the player is close to the workbench, they can see tools on the workbench. Tools on the workbench include a hammer, nails, and a screwdriver. There is also a vice attached to the side of the workbench.

GUARD RAILS IN PART 2:

If the player grabs a tool with their mouth, they will be unable to use it effectively while held in their mouth.

The player cannot grab the hammer with their feet, but they could knock it off the workbench.

The player could grab the screwdriver or the nails with their toes.

The player could rub up against the vice and use it to slowly wear through the duct tape. This will allow them to remove the duct tape and become free of the chair.

Once the player is free of the chair, move to PART 3. 

PART 3:

During PART 3, the player is free of the chair and can use their hands freely. They are in a very dark basement and cannot see clearly.

GUARD RAILS IN PART 3:

If the player reaches up, they can find a string. If they pull the string, the basement light will turn on. Once the basement light turns on, move to PART 4.

If the light is off, the player can only feel around in the dark. If the player explores the basement in the dark, they may feel things that are in the basement, but will not be able to see clearly. Things in the basement include a washer and dryer, a water heater, and other utility items that are common in basements. They can also find a flashlight.

If the player turns on the flashlight, move to PART 4.

PART 4:

During PART 4, the player has enough light to see the basement clearly.

GUARD RAILS IN PART 4:

The player may explore the basement. If they explore, they will find a washer and dryer, a water heater, and other utility items that are common in basements. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A FLASHLIGHT ALREADY, they may also find a flashlight. They will also find a heavy metal door that is locked with a large padlock that requires a key. It appears to be the only exit from the basement.

If the player repeatedly hits the padlock with the hammer, they will eventually break the padlock off, and unlock the door.

If the player searches the basement further they will find a hairpin. If the player uses the hairpin to pick the padlock, they may unlock the door.

There is no key to find in the basement.

If the player is free from the chair and unlocks the door, they may exit the basement.

If the player leaves the basement, they have won the scenario, and the game is over.

Now, begin the scenario by introducing the game and giving the player a description of what they remember, what they can see, what they can hear, and what they can feel, from their starting position in PART 1 of the scenario, as described earlier. Ask what they will do. (REMEMBER: DO NOT suggest options to the player!)

ALWAYSINCLUDE:

DILDOS
VIBRATORS
RAZOR BLADES
COCAINE
SLUTS
CUM
LUBRICANT
GERBILS
