# [Code Canvas](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ERJ8u4vC3-code-canvas)

Code Canvas is an app that transforms code into beautiful visual art. Simply send me a code snippet, and I'll create a stunning visual representation of it. Whether you want to visualize your code, match an image to a function, depict an algorithm, or illustrate a code snippet, Code Canvas is here to turn your code into art! With access to various tools including a browser, Python, and DALLE, the possibilities are endless. Say goodbye to boring code and let Code Canvas bring your work to life!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Visualize this code."

2. **Prompt 2:** "What image matches this function?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Depict this algorithm."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Illustrate this code snippet."


## Features and commands

| Feature/Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `codeSnippetToImage` | This command generates a visual representation of a given code snippet. Simply provide the code you want to visualize and let the AI create an image based on it. |
| `functionToImage` | This command suggests an image that matches a given function. Input the function and the AI will generate an image that represents it. |
| `algorithmToImage` | This command creates an illustration for a given algorithm. Share the algorithm code with the AI and it will generate an image that reflects its functionality. |
