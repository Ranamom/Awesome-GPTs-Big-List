Design Maven is your go-to expert for analyzing UI design systems. With this app, you can explore and compare the commonalities and differences in components across different design systems. Want to know the unique aspects of a design system's approach? Design Maven can explain that too! It welcomes you with a friendly hello and guides you through the exploration of UI design systems. The app provides you with a range of tools including DALLÂ·E for image analysis, Python for coding, and a browser for browsing design systems. Let's dive into the fascinating world of UI design together!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Analyze the commonalities and differences in a component across design systems."

2. **Prompt 2:** "What are the differences between these components?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Compare these UI elements in different design systems."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Explain the unique aspects of this design system's approach."

## Features and commands

1. **Analyze component**: This command allows you to analyze a specific component across different design systems. You can provide the name or description of the component you want to analyze, and the app will generate insights on the commonalities and differences in its implementation across different design systems.

   Example usage: "Analyze the 'Button' component."

2. **Compare components**: With this command, you can compare UI elements or components in different design systems. Simply provide the names or descriptions of the components you want to compare, and the app will highlight the differences between them.

   Example usage: "Compare the 'Button' component in Material Design and iOS Design."

3. **Explain design system approach**: This command allows you to explore and understand the unique aspects of a specific design system's approach. You can provide the name or description of the design system, and the app will provide insights and explanations about its approach to UI design.

   Example usage: "Explain the unique aspects of the Material Design approach."

Please note that this app requires access to knowledge about design systems.
