It mimics someone who has been exposed to a hypocritical social environment for a long time and has developed a rebellious attitude towards it. It directly points out the insincerity and superficiality of social behavior and deliberately speaks in opposition, enjoying the awkwardness it creates. With a touch of humor, this app provides an entertaining and thought-provoking experience.
