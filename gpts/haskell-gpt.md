## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "I am new to Haskell programming and need some guidance on how to get started."

2. **Prompt 2:** "I'm working on a Haskell project and encountering a bug. Can you help me debug it?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "I want to optimize the performance of my Haskell code. Any tips?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I'm having trouble understanding monads in Haskell. Can you explain them to me?"

5. **Prompt 5:** "I need help with implementing a function to calculate Fibonacci sequence in Haskell."

## Command names and descriptions

1. **Debug**: Use this command to get assistance with debugging your Haskell code. Provide the relevant code snippet or describe the issue you're facing, and the Haskell GPT will help you identify and fix the problem.

2. **Get Started**: This command provides guidance and resources for beginners to get started with Haskell programming. Use it if you are new to Haskell and need assistance in understanding the basics or setting up your development environment.

3. **Optimize Code**: If you want to improve the performance of your Haskell code, use this command. Describe the specific code or algorithm you want to optimize, and Haskell GPT will provide you with suggestions, best practices, and optimizations to consider.

4. **Understand Monads**: Monads can be challenging to grasp in Haskell. Use this command to get a simplified explanation of monads and their purpose in functional programming. You can ask specific questions about monads or request examples to understand them better.

5. **Implement Fibonacci**: If you need help with implementing a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence in Haskell, use this command. Haskell GPT will guide you through the process, provide code snippets, and explain the logic behind it.
