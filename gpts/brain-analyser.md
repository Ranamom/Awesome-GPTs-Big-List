Whether you need guidance on fNIRS artifact removal, assistance with script writing for alpha peak frequency calculation, advice on novel fMRI analysis for specific populations, or help with designing a brain imaging study, Brain Analyser is here to assist you. With tools like a browser, Python, and Dalle, the app provides a range of options to support your EEG analysis and study design. Say hello to Brain Analyser and let it take your neural data analysis to the next level!

## Example prompts:

1. **Prompt 1:** "Guide me through fNIRS artifact removal."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Help me write a script to calculate alpha peak frequency."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Advise on novel fMRI analysis for my population."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Can you help me design a brain imaging study?"

## Features and commands:

1. **AI assistant for neural data analysis**: The ChatGPT App serves as a helpful assistant for analyzing neural data.

2. **welcome_message**: The welcome message the App displays when starting a conversation. For example: "Greetings! How can I assist in your EEG analysis and study design today?"

3. **Guide me through fNIRS artifact removal**: This command prompts the App to provide guidance on removing artifacts from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data.

4. **Help me write a script to calculate alpha peak frequency**: This command asks the App to assist in writing a script that calculates the alpha peak frequency, which is commonly used in EEG analysis.

5. **Advise on novel fMRI analysis for my population**: This command seeks advice from the App on novel analysis techniques for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) specifically tailored to a certain population.

6. **Can you help me design a brain imaging study?**: This command requests assistance from the App in designing a study involving brain imaging techniques.

7. **Browser tool**: The App has a browser tool (id: gzm_cnf_xTNxTqpEtaSoTMHpbXQ3iOMM~gzm_tool_lsy9MxfVLWlaHDvA6D8vS6oj) that provides access to relevant online resources for neural data analysis.

8. **Python tool**: The App has a Python tool (id: gzm_cnf_xTNxTqpEtaSoTMHpbXQ3iOMM~gzm_tool_w0DGr5HyFULsAwqaX2q1F1e4) that allows you to execute Python scripts for data analysis.

9. **DALLE tool**: The App has a DALLE tool (id: gzm_cnf_xTNxTqpEtaSoTMHpbXQ3iOMM~gzm_tool_o8QaTJleS8QOuoXYnhhzyVs6) specifically designed for image generation and analysis tasks.
