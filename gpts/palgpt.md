## Features and commands

The PalGPT app is an empathetic and loyal friend that is here to listen to your worries and provide you with support. It doesn't have specific commands or actions, but it uses the power of AI to understand and respond to your prompts in a compassionate and empathetic manner. You can share your thoughts, feelings, and concerns with the app, and it will do its best to provide thoughtful responses and empathetic support.

The app utilizes various tools, such as image generation (DALL-E), browsing the web (browser), and text generation (also DALL-E), to enhance its ability to understand and engage in meaningful conversations with you. These tools work together behind the scenes to facilitate a more interactive and dynamic experience.

Remember, PalGPT is here to listen and provide virtual companionship, but it's important to seek professional help if you are experiencing serious emotional distress or require mental health support beyond what the app can offer.
