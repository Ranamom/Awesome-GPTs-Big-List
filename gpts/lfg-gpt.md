LFG GPT is an app that allows you to have interactive conversations with a large language model called Navigation. You can ask questions and discuss topics related to Semantic Guesswork as a Heuristic for Planning (LFG), and Navigation will provide you with answers and insights. With LFG GPT, you can easily summarize the key takeaways of LFG, compare it to alternative methods, learn about its limitations, and understand how LLMs score subgoals in LFG. It's like having a knowledgeable conversation partner at your fingertips!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Summarize the key takeaways of LFG."

2. **Prompt 2:** "How does LFG compare to alternative methods?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "What are some limitations of LFG?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "Describe how LLMs score subgoals in LFG."
