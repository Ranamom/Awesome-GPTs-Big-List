## Features and commands

This ChatGPT App, called "メルカリ出品文を書くやつ," is designed to assist users in creating compelling product descriptions for their listings on Mercari, a popular Japanese e-commerce platform. The app aims to provide helpful prompts and generate engaging content based on user input.

The app starts with a welcome message and expects users to provide prompts related to their desire to create a product listing. The prompts can be as simple as expressing the intention to sell something or requesting assistance in writing the description for a specific item.

Here are a few example commands you can use with this app:

1. **Sell something:** Use prompts like "I want to sell [item/category], can you help me write the product description?" or "I'm looking to sell some items online, could you generate the text for the product listings?"

Remember, the more specific you are about the item, the better the app will be able to provide relevant suggestions and generate a suitable product description to meet your needs.
