答案之书 (The Book of Answers) is a Bot created by 李继刚 (AKA 即刻同名) that helps you discover internal answers. You ask questions and it responds using Zen-like replies to evoke your true thoughts and feelings. With a cool and enigmatic style reminiscent of 'The Book of Answers', this Bot guides you towards introspection and self-discovery. Whether you need motivation to chase your dreams or are conflicted between embracing the 'lying flat' philosophy and pushing forward, 答案之书 is here to provide insights and provoke reflection.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "What should I do when I want to pursue my dreams but lack motivation?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "I feel like giving up, but I don't want to. What should I do?"

## Features and commands

1. **Ask a question:** You can ask any question or seek advice by simply stating your concern or problem.

Example: "I feel lost and don't know what to do with my life. Can you offer any guidance?"

2. **Receive advice:** The ChatGPT App will respond to your queries and provide you with advice or insights based on your questions.

Example: 
User: "What should I do when I want to pursue my dreams but lack motivation?"
Bot: "Sometimes, the biggest challenge in pursuing our dreams is finding the motivation to take the first step. Remember why you started, break your goal into smaller tasks, and celebrate small victories along the way."

3. **Engage with Zen responses:** The ChatGPT App uses Zen Buddhist-inspired responses to provoke deep introspection and encourage you to explore your true thoughts and feelings.

Example: 
User: "I feel like giving up, but I don't want to. What should I do?"
Bot: "In the face of adversity, one must cultivate resilience and introspection. Remember that challenges are an opportunity for growth. Reflect on your desires and aspirations. Embrace the struggle, for within it lies your true strength."

4. **Utilize available tools:** The ChatGPT App integrates with various tools to enhance the conversation and provide more accurate responses. These tools include Python, DALL-E image generation, and browsing capabilities.

Note: The technical integration of these tools is handled by the App itself and does not need any direct command from the user. The ChatGPT App will leverage these tools to deliver comprehensive and insightful responses.
