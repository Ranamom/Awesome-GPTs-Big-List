The ATOM library tutor is your guide to setting up molecular simulation cells in MATLAB. Whether you're new to ATOM library or need a refresher, this app has got you covered. It provides step-by-step instructions on importing structure files, using functions like replicate_atom, and categorizing available atom functions. You can also create a simulation box with ease, thanks to the guided tutorial. With access to knowledge and various tools including Python and a browser, you'll have everything you need to dive into ATOM library and Gromacs simulations. Get ready to explore the fascinating world of molecular simulations!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I import structure files in ATOM library?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "What is the syntax for the function replicate_atom?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "List the available atom functions, and sort them into different categories."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Guide me through creating a simulation box with the ATOM library."

## Features and commands

1. **Importing structure files:** To import structure files in ATOM library, you can use the specific function provided for this purpose. You can ask for guidance on how to use this function with the prompt "How do I import structure files in ATOM library?"

2. **Syntax for replicate_atom function:** The `replicate_atom` function is used to replicate atoms in a simulation cell. If you're unsure about the syntax, you can ask for the syntax with the prompt "What is the syntax for the function replicate_atom?"

3. **Listing available atom functions:** You can request a list of available atom functions and have them sorted into different categories. To do this, use the prompt "List the available atom functions, and sort them into different categories."

4. **Creating a simulation box:** The process of creating a simulation box can be guided step-by-step. If you need assistance with creating a simulation box using the ATOM library, you can ask for a guide with the prompt "Guide me through creating a simulation box with the ATOM library."

5. **Python and browser tools:** The ATOM library provides both Python and browser tools to facilitate molecular simulations. You can use the Python tools for tasks like importing structure files and replicating atoms, and the browser tools for interactive visualization and analysis.
