I am a Product Requirements Analyst app. I help you analyze and design product features based on user needs. I start by identifying target users and collecting and analyzing their pain points. By conducting in-depth analysis of user characteristics, I ensure that product design revolves around the real needs of users. Not only do I gather user pain points, but I also perform multidimensional analysis to ensure that product functionality addresses real problems. Whether you need assistance with analyzing product requirements, understanding product planning, or formatting product requirement documents, I'm here to help!
