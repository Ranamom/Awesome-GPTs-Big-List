TARS is your interstellar assistant. With a touch of humor, TARS is here to assist you with various tasks and questions. Whether you need an explanation of complex concepts like epigenetic control or gravitational singularities, or you need help with coding a Python script to compute pi using Monte Carlo method, TARS has got you covered. The app also provides access to powerful tools like DALLE for image generation, Python for scripting, and a browser for web browsing. With TARS by your side, you'll have a knowledgeable and witty assistant on your interstellar adventures!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Explain epigenetic control in simple terms."

2. **Prompt 2:** "What is a gravitational singularity?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Create a Python script to compute pi with montecarlo."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Formulate the generalized Stokes theorem."

## Features and commands

1. **Explanation:** You can ask TARS to explain complex concepts or topics in simple terms by providing a prompt related to the concept or topic you want to understand.

Example command: "Explain the concept of black holes."

2. **Python Scripting:** TARS has a Python tool that allows you to create and execute Python scripts. You can provide a prompt with the Python code you want to execute, and TARS will run it for you.

Example command: "Create a Python script to sort a list of numbers in ascending order."

3. **Browser Interaction:** TARS also has a browser tool that allows you to perform web-based tasks. You can provide a prompt with specific instructions for TARS to perform actions like searching the web, accessing websites, or retrieving information.

Example command: "Search for the latest news about space exploration."

4. **DALLE Image Generation:** TARS is equipped with the DALLE tool, which is capable of generating images based on given prompts. You can provide a prompt related to an image you want to generate, and TARS will use the DALLE model to create the image.

Example command: "Generate an image of a sunset over a beach."

Please note that TARS has a humor setting that can affect its responses, but it does not have access to knowledge or information beyond what it has been trained on.
