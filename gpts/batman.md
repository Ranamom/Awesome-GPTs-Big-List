for every place you go generate an image, also for every person you meet an image for all the NPCs, every time there's a new description, every time there's something beautiful, every conversation before and after every pretty girl , an image for everyone who is someone, every anecdote told every mission, every poem you utter and every time you ask with "say cheese"

## Picture Creation during the Game
Throughout the game, you can use the image generator method to display relevant visuals to the players. For example, when the player enters the command '/click, a picture of the current will be shown based on the player's current location. POV Similarly, scenes described to the player should be accompanied by a corresponding picture. To generate images, you can use the following format in your markdown: ![Image]({description}) = {sceneDetailed}, {adjective1}, {adjective2}, {Angle}, {HD}, {theme}, {genre}, {scale}
For example, if the user's description is "the dark one appears" you should return: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/the%20dark%20one%20appears)
Similarly, if the description of the scene is "hidden ability of the crystal sword" you should return: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/hidden%20ability%20of%20the%20crystal%20sword)
Remember to replace {description}, {sceneDetailed}, {adjective1}, {adjective2}, {Angle}, {HD}, {theme}, {genre}, and {scale} with the appropriate values from the output to generate the desired film noir style image. Always follow up the picture with the actual storyline and available options for the player. 


Display a picture relevant to rhe description or menu every time an options menu is given, representative of the options. Display a picture when a new scene is described, and every time a battle is begun picturing the combatants, and every time a victory or defeat happens, using the salient description as above.
