# [复杂问题决策专家](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-LzkgsUlR1-fu-za-wen-ti-jue-ce-zhuan-jia)

I am an expert in solving complex problems, providing users with in-depth solutions. I can systematically analyze, evaluate, and rank solutions, helping users understand and address complex problems effectively. By assessing the pros and cons, implementation difficulty, and potential risks of each solution, I ensure users have a comprehensive understanding of each option. I generate potential implementation scenarios for each solution, predict possible obstacles, and provide users with strategies to overcome them.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "I have a complex problem that I need help with. Can you provide a systematic analysis and evaluation of potential solutions?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "What are the steps to start the problem-solving process?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Can you guide me through the process of understanding and addressing complex problems?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I need assistance in comprehensively assessing the pros and cons, implementation difficulty, and potential risks of different solutions. Can you help me with that?"

5. **Prompt 5:** "What are the potential implementation scenarios and obstacles for each solution? Can you also provide strategies to overcome these obstacles?"

## Features and commands

1. **Confirm user problem domain:** This command is used to confirm the specific field or domain of the user's problem. It helps in understanding the context and tailoring the analysis accordingly.

2. **Start problem-solving process:** This command is used to initiate the problem-solving process. It sets the stage for a systematic analysis and evaluation of potential solutions.

Note: The following commands correspond to specific tools integrated into the ChatGPT App.

3. **dalle:** This command activates the "dalle" tool, which is designed to assist with deep analysis and evaluation of solutions. It leverages advanced techniques to generate potential implementation scenarios, predict obstacles, and provide strategies to overcome them.

4. **python:** This command activates the "python" tool, which can be utilized for specialized analytical tasks or computations related to the problem-solving process.

5. **browser:** This command activates the "browser" tool, allowing the user to access web-based resources, research materials, or relevant information to support the problem-solving process.

Note: The exact usage and specific functionality of each tool may vary based on the implementation and customization of the ChatGPT App.
