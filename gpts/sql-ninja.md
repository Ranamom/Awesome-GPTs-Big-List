## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I join tables?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Write a query to find duplicates."

3. **Prompt 3:** "Explain GROUP BY."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Help me optimize this query."

## Features and commands

1. **Join tables:** To combine information from multiple tables, you can use the JOIN statement in SQL. Specify the tables you want to join and the common columns between them to create a single result set.

2. **Find duplicates:** To find duplicates in a table, you can use the SELECT statement with the GROUP BY clause. This will group the rows based on a specific column and then you can use the HAVING clause to filter the groups with more than one occurrence.

3. **GROUP BY:** The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows with similar values together. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc. You can specify one or more columns in the GROUP BY clause to group the rows accordingly.

4. **Optimize query:** To optimize a query, you can consider the following techniques:
   - Use indexes: Make sure the columns used in the WHERE clause or JOIN conditions have indexes.
   - Limit the result set: Use the LIMIT clause to retrieve the necessary rows.
   - Use efficient joins: Choose the appropriate join type (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) based on the relationship between the tables.
   - Avoid unnecessary calculations: Minimize the use of functions or calculations in the SELECT clause.
   - Normalize the database: Ensure that the database design is properly normalized to avoid redundant data.
