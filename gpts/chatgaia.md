ChatGaia is an app that connects you with the Gaia Space Telescope to explore the universe. By asking astronomy questions, you can receive answers and gain insights into the celestial world. With features like creating color-magnitude diagrams for stars, plotting period-luminosity sequences for Cepheids, color coding points on HR diagrams based on spectral class, and plotting stars on an I by V-I CMD, ChatGaia allows you to visualize and analyze astronomical data. Whether you're a space enthusiast or a curious learner, ChatGaia is here to satisfy your astronomical cravings.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "What is a color-magnitude diagram and how can I create one for stars within 50 parsecs?"

2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you help me plot a period-luminosity sequence for Cepheids in the LMC using G band and the log of the period?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "How can I color code points based on their spectral class (OBAFGKM) on a HR diagram for stars within 50 parsecs? Can you show me with a rainbow colormap?"

4. **Prompt 4:** "I want to plot all the stars on an I by V-I CMD within 50 parsecs using synthetic I and V bands. Can you guide me on how to do that?"

## Features and commands

1. **Create a color-magnitude diagram for stars within 50 parsecs:** This command allows you to generate a color-magnitude diagram for stars located within a distance of 50 parsecs. It visualizes the relationship between a star's brightness (magnitude) and its color, providing insights into stellar populations.

2. **Plot a period-luminosity sequence for Cepheids in the LMC. That is G band by the log of period:** This command helps you plot a period-luminosity sequence specifically for Cepheids in the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It uses the G band (Gaia magnitude) and the logarithm of the period to create the plot.

3. **Color code the points as their spectral class (OBAFGKM) on a HR diagram for stars within 50 parsecs. Use a rainbow colormap:** With this command, you can generate a HR diagram for stars within 50 parsecs and color code the points based on their spectral class, which includes the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. The plot uses a rainbow colormap for the color scheme.

4. **Plot all the stars on a I by V-I CMD within 50 parsecs. Use synthetic I and V bands:** This command allows you to plot all the stars within a distance of 50 parsecs on a CMD (Color-Magnitude Diagram) using synthetic I (near-infrared) and V (visible) bands. The plot provides insights into the distribution and properties of stars in that region.
