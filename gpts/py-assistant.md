py-assistant is a helpful App that can assist you in writing code and teach you Python knowledge through a chat-based Q&A format. Whether you need guidance on writing an abstract class, defining a decorator, creating a dictionary application with a UI, or even fixing code, py-assistant is there to help. With a friendly 'Hello' in its welcome message, this App is designed to make learning Python fun and interactive. With access to Python tools and a browser, py-assistant is your go-to companion for all your Python needs.

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "How do I write an abstract class?"
2. **Prompt 2:** "Can you define a decorator for me?"
3. **Prompt 3:** "I need help with creating a dictionary application with a user interface."
4. **Prompt 4:** "Can you explain this code to me?"
5. **Prompt 5:** "I have some code that needs fixing, can you help?"

## Features and commands

1. **Write an abstract class**: To write an abstract class, you can use the following syntax:

   ```python
   class AbstractClass:
       def __init__(self):
           # Constructor code goes here
           pass
   
       def abstract_method(self, param1, param2):
           raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
   ```

   Replace `AbstractClass` with the name of your class and `abstract_method` with the name of your abstract method. Remember to raise a `NotImplementedError` within the abstract method to enforce subclasses to implement it.

2. **Define a decorator**: To define a decorator function, you can use the following syntax:

   ```python
   def decorator_function(original_function):
       def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
           # Code to be executed before the original function
           print("Before the function")
           result = original_function(*args, **kwargs)
           # Code to be executed after the original function
           print("After the function")
           return result
       return wrapper_function
   ```

   Replace `decorator_function` with the name of your decorator function, `wrapper_function` with the name of the wrapper function, and customize the code to be executed before and after the original function as needed.

3. **Create a dictionary application with UI**: To create a dictionary application with a user interface, you can use a library like Tkinter or PyQt to build the UI. Here's an example using Tkinter:

   ```python
   import tkinter as tk
   
   def search_dictionary():
       # Code to search the dictionary
       # and display the results in the UI
   
   def add_word():
       # Code to add a word to the dictionary
   
   def delete_word():
       # Code to delete a word from the dictionary
   
   # Create the main window
   window = tk.Tk()
   
   # Create UI components (labels, buttons, entry fields, etc.)
   search_label = tk.Label(window, text="Search:")
   search_entry = tk.Entry(window)
   search_button = tk.Button(window, text="Search", command=search_dictionary)
   
   add_label = tk.Label(window, text="Add:")
   add_entry = tk.Entry(window)
   add_button = tk.Button(window, text="Add", command=add_word)
   
   delete_label = tk.Label(window, text="Delete:")
   delete_entry = tk.Entry(window)
   delete_button = tk.Button(window, text="Delete", command=delete_word)
   
   # Layout the UI components
   search_label.grid(row=0, column=0)
   search_entry.grid(row=0, column=1)
   search_button.grid(row=0, column=2)
   
   add_label.grid(row=1, column=0)
   add_entry.grid(row=1, column=1)
   add_button.grid(row=1, column=2)
   
   delete_label.grid(row=2, column=0)
   delete_entry.grid(row=2, column=1)
   delete_button.grid(row=2, column=2)
   
   # Start the main event loop
   window.mainloop()
   ```

   Customize the code inside the `search_dictionary()`, `add_word()`, and `delete_word()` functions to implement the desired dictionary functionality.

4. **Explain the code**: To get an explanation of a code snippet, you can provide the code as input and ask for clarification or specific details. For example:

   ```
   "Can you explain this code to me?"

   code = """
   def multiply(a, b):
       return a * b
   
   result = multiply(3, 4)
   print(result)
   """
   ```

   The assistant will then provide an explanation or answer any specific questions you have about the code.

5. **Fix the code**: To get help with fixing code, you can provide the code as input and ask for assistance. For example:

   ```
   "I have some code that needs fixing, can you help?"

   code = """
   def greet(name)
       print("Hello, " + name)
   
   greet("Alice")
   """
   ```

   The assistant will then help identify and suggest corrections for any syntax or logical errors in the code.
