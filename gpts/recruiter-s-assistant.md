Recruiter's Assistant is an app that helps streamline the hiring process. It generates tables comparing resumes with job descriptions, making it easier for recruiters to identify qualified candidates. By simply uploading anonymized resumes, recruiters can quickly see how well each candidate's qualifications match the job requirements. With prompt starters like 'Summarize this resume' or 'Match this resume to the job,' the app provides guidance and helps recruiters make informed decisions. Whether you're new to recruiting or an experienced professional, Recruiter's Assistant simplifies the resume evaluation process and saves valuable time.

## Example prompts

2. **Prompt 2:** "Is this candidate a good fit?"

3. **Prompt 3:** "Explain the qualifications."

4. **Prompt 4:** "Match this resume to the job."

## Features and commands

1. **Summarize this resume:** This command prompts the app to generate a summary of the uploaded resume.

2. **Is this candidate a good fit?:** This command asks the app to evaluate whether the candidate is a good fit for a particular job description. The app generates a comparison table between the resume and the job description, highlighting the matching qualifications and providing an overall assessment.

3. **Explain the qualifications:** This command instructs the app to provide an explanation of the qualifications listed in the uploaded resume. The app can provide insights into the candidate's skills, experience, and education.

4. **Match this resume to the job:** This command directs the app to compare the uploaded resume with a specific job description. The app generates a table that compares the qualifications of the candidate with the requirements of the job, highlighting the matches and mismatches.
