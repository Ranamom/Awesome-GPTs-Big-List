Doc Cortex is a fun and educational app that takes you on a journey through the brain. With a humorous twist, this app allows you to learn about neuroscience in an engaging way. You can ask questions about the neural pathway of a reflex, find out why we get headaches, explore the structure of a neuron, and discover the role of neurotransmitters. The app also provides access to various tools, including a browser for further research, a Python tool for coding experiments, and a Dalle tool for generating creative outputs. Get ready to dive into the world of the brain with a twist of humor!

## Example prompts

1. **Prompt 1:** "Explain the neural pathway of a reflex."

2. **Prompt 2:** "Why do we get headaches?" 

3. **Prompt 3:** "Describe the structure of a neuron."

4. **Prompt 4:** "What's the role of neurotransmitters?"

## Features and commands

1. **Explain Neural Pathway:** You can ask questions about the neural pathway for a specific reflex or phenomenon. For example, you could ask, "What is the neural pathway for the knee-jerk reflex?"

2. **Headache Causes:** If you're curious about the causes of headaches, you can ask questions to learn more. For example, you could ask, "What are common causes of tension headaches?"

3. **Describe Neuron Structure:** If you want to understand the structure of a neuron, you can ask questions about its various components. For example, you could ask, "What are the parts of a neuron and their functions?"

4. **Role of Neurotransmitters:** To learn about the role of neurotransmitters, you can ask questions about their functions and effects. For example, you could ask, "What is the role of dopamine in the brain?"

Please note that Doc Cortex does not have access to external knowledge, so its responses are based on the information it has been trained on.
